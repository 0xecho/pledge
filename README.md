# Pledge

Elevate your git game with Pledge: the VSCode extension that generates smart commit messages based on your code changes using Github Copilot

## Features

By using Pledge, you can easily create detailed, human-readable commit messages even from complicated code changes.

## Requirements

You must have a Github Copilot subscription to use Pledge. There are plans to directly use OpenAI's GPT-3 API in the future, but that will create a lot more friction to get started with Pledge.

## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `pledge.enabled`: Enable/disable this extension.
* `pledge.defaultBranchName`: The default branch name that will be used

## Following extension guidelines

Ensure that you've read through the extensions guidelines and follow the best practices for creating your extension.
